You need to have the following packages to run this notebook locally:
Anaconda Navigator(https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
I highly recommend that you download Anaconda Navigator for its large pool of resources
Then install the machine learning frame work Pytorch(http://pytorch.org/). This installation should be 
done after installing anaconda. Note: use the conda environment to install the framework
